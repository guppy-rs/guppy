A command-line frontend for `guppy`.

`cargo-guppy` provides a frontend for running `guppy` queries.

## Installing

`cargo-guppy` is currently a work in progress, and not yet on `crates.io`. To install it, ensure
you have `cargo` installed (preferably through [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)), then run:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/guppy-rs/guppy --branch main cargo-guppy
```

This will make the `cargo guppy` command available.

## Commands

The list of commands is not currently stable and is subject to change.

### Query commands

* `select`: query packages and their transitive dependencies
* `resolve-cargo`: query packages and features as would be built by cargo
* `subtree-size`: print dependencies along with their unique subtree size
* `dups`: print duplicate packages

### Diff commands

* `diff`: perform a diff of two `cargo metadata` JSON outputs
* `diff-summaries`: perform a diff of two [summaries](https://github.com/guppy-rs/guppy/tree/main/guppy-summaries)

### Workspace manipulations

* `mv`: move crates to a new location in a workspace, updating paths along the way
