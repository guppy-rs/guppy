//! Fixtures for target-spec-miette.
//!
//! This module contains test fixtures for the target-spec-miette crate,
//! typically around testing invalid inputs of various kinds.
//!
//! These fixtures can be used in downstream crates to verify that bad inputs
//! are gracefully handled, particularly by showing good error messages. (Good
//! error messages are part of why this library exists in the first place).
//!
//! The target-spec-miette library itself uses them via the
//! [`datatest-stable`](https://docs.rs/datatest-stable) crate.
//!
//! The exact contents of each directory are not part of the semver guarantees,
//! so using this module is only recommended in tests, and with a checked-in
//! `Cargo.lock`. A minor update to target-spec-miette may require that your
//! tests also be updated.
