/// Support for maintaining `Cargo.toml` files that unify features in a workspace.
///
/// This struct maintains a context around a `Cargo.toml` file. It provides facilities for diffing
/// the contents of the file, and for writing out new contents.
///
/// # Structure of the Cargo.toml file
///
/// The `Cargo.toml` file is treated as partially generated. It is expected to have a section marked
/// off as, for example:
///
/// ```toml
/// [package]
/// ...
///
/// ### BEGIN HAKARI SECTION
/// [dependencies]
/// ...
///
/// [build-dependencies]
/// ...
///
/// [dev-dependencies]
/// ...
/// ### END HAKARI SECTION
/// ```
///
/// The part of the `Cargo.toml` file between the `BEGIN HAKARI SECTION` and `END HAKARI SECTION`
/// lines is managed by this struct, and changes to it may not be preserved. The part of the file
/// outside this section can be edited and its contents will be preserved.
///
/// # Setting up a new package
///
/// For Hakari to manage a package, a bit of initial prep work must be done:
///
/// 1. Add a new library package in a desired location within your workspace, for example: `cargo
///    new --lib hakari-package`.
/// 2. Copy and paste the following lines of code to the end of the package's `Cargo.toml` file. Be
///    sure to put in a trailing newline.
///
///     ```toml
///     ### BEGIN HAKARI SECTION
///
///     ### END HAKARI SECTION
///
///     ```
///
/// 3. Add an empty `build.rs` file (the exact contents don't matter, but the presence of this file
///    makes build dependencies work properly).
///
///     ```
///     fn main() {}
///     ```
