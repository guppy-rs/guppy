/// A store for null-separated paths.
///
/// This manages paths on Unix and Windows platforms, including converting `/` on Windows to `\`.
///
/// # Null-separated paths
///
/// Paths as produced by tools like `git diff --name-only` are typically separated by newline
/// characters (`\n`). However, on Unix platforms filenames can themselves have newlines embedded in
/// them, so source control systems often end up [quoting newlines and other "unusual"
/// characters](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-corequotePath).
///
/// A robust, lossless way to retrieve a list of paths is by separating them with null characters.
/// Both Unix and Windows platforms guarantee that a path can never have embedded null characters.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Most source control systems can provide null-separated paths. These examples are expected to be
/// run from the Cargo workspace root (which is assumed to be the same as the repository root).
///
/// In most cases, you'll want to compare the current working directory against the [*merge
/// base*][mb], or [*nearest/greatest/lowest common
/// ancestor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor), of the current commit with a
/// specified upstream revision, such as `origin/main`. To do so, run:
///
/// * Git: `git diff -z --name-only $(git merge-base <upstream rev> HEAD)`
/// * Mercurial: `hg status --print0 -mard --no-status --rev 'ancestor(<upstream rev>,.)'`
///
/// [mb]:
///     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1549146/git-find-the-most-recent-common-ancestor-of-two-branches
///
/// ---
///
/// **NOTE:**
/// * The `$()` syntax in Bash and other shells means "run the command and insert its contents
///   here".
/// * Git provides a syntax `<upstream rev>...` which purports to use the merge base, but it ignores
///   uncommitted changes. Executing `git merge-base` as a separate command is the only way to
///   include uncommitted changes.
/// * The `-mard` flag to `hg status` means that untracked files are not included. `git diff` does
///   not have an option to display untracked files. For more discussion, see the documentation for
///   [`add_changed_paths`](crate::Determinator::add_changed_paths).
///
/// ---
///
/// In general, to obtain a list of changed paths between two revisions (omit `<new rev>` if
/// comparing against the working directory):
///
/// * Git: `git diff -z --name-only <old rev> <new rev>`
/// * Mercurial: `hg status --print0 -mard --no-status <old rev> <new rev>`
///
/// To obtain a list of all files in the working directory that are tracked by the source control
/// system:
///
/// * Git: `git ls-files -z`
/// * Mercurial: `hg files --print0`
///
/// Null-separated paths are produced through the `-z` option to Git commands, or the `--print0`
/// option to Mercurial. If you're using a different system, check its help for instructions.
